it has a menu with 6 options 1.Add expense 2.Change/set monthly goal 3.View expenses 4.Change custom percentage 5.Clear data 6.Exit
the value you put into the add expense will be saved in a .csv file
has a reminder system when you're getting close to spending all your budget you can set a custom value but it will always remind at 75% and 90% and when you are over budget

monthly goal is the budget you set the month (the list doesn't reset automatically every month you need to do it manually)
3. is self explanatory you look at the list
4. set custom percentage is basically what percentage spent before it warns you
clear data is clearing the list of all expense

yeah thats basically it
